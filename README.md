Programming for Data Science submission repository
# My first R Markdown file

This markdown file is for the first assignment for the Programming for Data Science course.
This assignment is to familiarize the class with GitHub, account creation and begin to use the website to share scripts.
Scripting languages reviewed include R and python. 
Using Anaconda navigator is a great tool to manage IDEs that use these languages and environments they use to execute code.
